## Abstract
  This project promotes an approach for Human Computer Interaction where physical mouse functions can be controlled using  a real time webcam or device camera.It's an alternative   to curent methods including manual input through keyboard physically.These type of projects uses device camera and computer vision techniques to     control various tasks that are controlled physically.  
## Problem Statement 
  In Today's world human life getting Technologically advance with the help of artificial intelligence. This project will help in making human life easier 
  and will act as a Time saver application by acting as a motion detecting application.
  The main aim of this project is to design and develop a virtual mouse application which can perform realtime drag and drop functions on your device through hand or fingers       gestures.
  The motivation is to create an object tracking application to interact with the computer, and develop a virtual human-computer interaction device.
